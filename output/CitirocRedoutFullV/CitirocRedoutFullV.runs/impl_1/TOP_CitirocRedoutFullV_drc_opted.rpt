CFGBVS-7#1 Warning
CONFIG_VOLTAGE with Config Bank VCCO  
The CONFIG_MODE property of current_design specifies a configuration mode (SPIx4) that uses pins in bank 14.  I/O standards used in this bank have a voltage requirement of 2.50.  However, the CONFIG_VOLTAGE for current_design is set to 1.8.  Ensure that your configuration voltage is compatible with the I/O standards in banks used by your configuration mode.  Refer to device configuration user guide for more information.    Pins used by config mode: B24 (IO_L1P_T0_D00_MOSI_14), A25 (IO_L1N_T0_D01_DIN_14), B22 (IO_L2P_T0_D02_14), A22 (IO_L2N_T0_D03_14), B25 (IO_L3P_T0_DQS_PUDC_B_14), and C23 (IO_L6P_T0_FCS_B_14)
